Implementation
Go to the linked Github https://github.com/myin3/Software-Engineering and clone the repository

Make sure the following python packages are installed. We recommend using a virtual environment: 
pip install django
pip install django-crispy-forms
pip install mysqlclient (For linux and mac systems
	NOTE: mysqlclient will require additional software before you can add the package. It is recommended you already have MySQL server installed before installing mysqlclient. See https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/ 
For windows systems, youâ€™ll need to compile mysqlclient from source, which is hard. Instead, it is easier to download a third party python wheel file for mysqlclient, and then move it to the project folder. (The same folder where the manage.py file is located). Download the latest mysqlclient wheel file from this site https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and move the .whl file into the project folder.
Navigate to the directory containing manage.py and input the following command in the command line: 

python manage.py runserver

Open your preferred browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/gameplanapp/

This is connected to a mqsql database on Google Cloud Platform. To use a local sqlite3 database instead, go to settings.py and insert the following code to the bottom
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
    }
}

Then navigate to the directory containing manage.py and input the following commands

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
